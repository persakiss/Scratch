   The below code demonstrates one way that Array.reduce() could be used to

/* CHALLENGE 1
   Pretend there there is no Array.filter() method, only Array.reduce().
   How would you use Array.reduce() to mimic the filter method, thus that
   from the array below, you can create a new array composed of only the objects
   from the original array that contain a price property of 10 and over?
   Part of the code has been completed for you. 
   Complete the rest by uncommenting the return statement on line 36
   and writing the code for what to return when cur.price is >= 10.

   Examine the code below, then delete the line indicated inside the

   statement with a case for the 'update_hp' and 'update_pos' action 
   types, as well as a default case.

   an object with the content of: { hp: 800, xPosition: 205, yPosition: 190 }
